# volley

This is a small project written to (so far) do two things:

1) automatically generate much of the content of the PAC-12 Week X volleyball posts I have been doing for years
2) run a pablo-based monte carlo simulator of the NCAA D1 volleyball tournament in order to generate odds for teams to advance

Both applications use the pablo rating system that is published on RichKern.com
